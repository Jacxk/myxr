          The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the

          If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that
          any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then
          you may submit a written copyright infringement notification
          (&quot;Notification&quot;) using the contact details below pursuant to

          Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process.
          Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and
          completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our
          response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly
          infringing material.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account
          in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a
          good faith effort to contact the affected user with information
          concerning the removal or restriction of access.

          The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to
